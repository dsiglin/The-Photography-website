A simple and easy to use plugin to create fullscreen scrolling websites (also known as single page websites or onepage sites). It allows the creation of fullscreen scrolling websites, as well as adding some landscape sliders inside the sections of the site.

Thanks:
This site would not be possible without the wonderful fullpage.js plugin by ÁLVARO TRIGO, and the useability tests and feedback provided by AARON DICKEY and DAN DIETZ. I'm also indebted to DAN JEFFORDS for letting me field numerous questions.
